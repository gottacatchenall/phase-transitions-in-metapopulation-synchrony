# Metapopulation Synchrony Paper
- Different Distributions of $m$, $k$,  and $\lambda$ across pops to create source-sink dynamics
- Comparing modularity of synchrony to eigenvalue centrality
- How does synchrony change MTE?
- Use an SBM to measure modular stucture of communities from synchrony data

# Software Paper
- Estimate MTE from data
- Examine the changes in MTE do to potential corridors
    - How do you impose a constraint on what changes can be made to the dispersal potential?
